NCATS is the only center at the NIH that focuses exclusively on all aspects of the translation of research with an innovative pipeline of treatment discoveries for all diseases. NCATS brings together a diverse group of scientists, including medicinal chemists, biologists, toxicologists, clinicians, and engineers to translate basic science conducted elsewhere into products and services that help improve people\u2019s health and lives. NCATS\u2019 mission is to improve health through smarter science that results in better treatments faster for all diseases, rare or common. Within that remit, the NCATS ORDR\u2019s mission is to advance rare disease research to benefit patients.</p><p> </p><p>Currently, there are about 7,000-10,000 known rare diseases that affect people in the US, yet only a few hundred (less than 5%) have a treatment and even fewer a cure. A rare disease is defined in US law (Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of 1983,[1] Rare Diseases Act (RDA) of 2002[2]) as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Most rare diseases affect far fewer patients than this, with most rare diseases affecting only a few hundreds to thousands of patients. Collectively, however, rare diseases are not rare at all, and in total are estimated to affect as many as 25-30 million patients in the US, making rare diseases a large public health consideration. </p><p> </p><p>The ORDR\u2019s GARD information center was established in 2003 under a Congressional Mandate (RDA 2002), and is a federally funded program that has an essential role in the dissemination of public health information to rare disease researchers, clinicians, and patients that is freely accessible to the public. However, obtaining accurate, comprehensive, timely, and objective information on rare diseases is often difficult, given the large number of rare diseases, rapidly evolving science (especially related to genomics), diverse data sources, and inconsistent nomenclature and ontologies for rare disease classification, among other issues. Recently, GARD has been undergoing a re-envisioning and re-design based on a Neo4j knowledge graph database that integrates rare disease data from multiple sources to keep the information on ~6,000 different rare diseases in GARD up-to-date and useful to the patient and clinical research communities. Research tools, artificial intelligent models, data visualization and informatics infrastructure based on the knowledge graph database will be developed to support rare diseases research and clinical activities, and to answer rare disease research questions likely to inform rare disease research prioritization. </p><p> </p><p>[1] Orphan Drug Act of 1983, amended for prevalence 1984.
